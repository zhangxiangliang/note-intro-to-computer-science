# Backus-Naur Form

## Base
* <Non-terminal> -> replacement.

## Derivation
* A derivation just means starting from some non-terminal, follow the rules to derive a sequence of terminals.
* We're done when we have only terminals left and we can derive a sentence in the grammar.

* An infinitely large language with a small set of rules use Backus-Naur Form.
